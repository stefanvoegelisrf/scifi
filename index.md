### Excercise: Writing opening lines
- "Das stimmt überhaupt nicht, ich kann es nicht glauben, welche Worte du mir in den Mund legst.", antwortete er.
- "Ist das etwa die Stimme von XYZ die ich hinter mir höre?" fragte ich mich als ich in XYZ vorbeifuhr.
- Zwei Meter breit war dieser Bach mindestens, vielleicht sogar drei. Schätzen konnte ich nicht so gut, aber irgendwie muss ich da rüberkommen.
- "... einundzwanzig, dreiundzwanzig, vierundzwanzig.". Eine ganze Menge ist diesen Monat zusammengekommen.
- He was carefully combin his hair, but the comb slipped his fingers and flew 3 meters away.

### Excercise: Start a story
"Where were you last night?"
"Sigh. Kinda awkward to explain. You know that guy I told you about? The one I spilled my coffee over by accident?"
"Yeah, I remember. He yelled at you, right?"
"Exactly that guy. I met him today again on my way home. And funnily enough, he came up to me and apologized."
"Oh how nice of him, I'm quite a bit suprised to hear, after you mentioned what happened."
"I agree, however, he went on and invited me for a chat at the bar. Turns out, he's working at a place that I would love to work at. I told him a lot about my work and how I want to progress into the future. And guess what?"
"What?"
"I'm having an interview next week to start as XYZ."
"Whoa, congrats. I'm glad to hear that this unfortunate story turned into such a life changing situation"

### Characters
- Character is story and story is character. Story creates character.
- Fiction is a form of memoir. Mine your own life for the details of character. 
- How will your character take cliché and stand it on its head?
- The more you try to force things to fit a formula, the less authentic your book is going to sound.

### Developing ideas
- Great stories often star t with a question. The same is true for chapters and scenes. A novel is the sum total of a series of questions and answers.
- If there are boring bits in your story, you simply have to work your imagination harder. You must find a way of introducing drama into the situation.


### Topic: Music Consumption with AI
- Companies that have monopolized music generation using subliminal messages to gain influence
- Seeing a street musician, but then you can change how you hear it
  - Like improving the playing style or correcting the lyrics
- Using AI to censor music
  - Like in the concert where James Hype was not allowed to have swearwords in his songs in china, where you have a system that automatically recognizes the music and then censors it
- Taking music monopolies to the max
  - Small musicians are not able to make money anymore and no new talents emerge as music is always generated
  - Old very successful musicians only earn money anymore
- Music recycling of old melodies
  - A small set of songs get recycled over and over again, people forget that you can make music yourself
- Completely personalized music listening experience
  - Connected to emotion, music can adjust your emotion or have very specific effect on yourself
  - Only generated music
  - People go to festivals but they all hear different music and artists
- Music taste transforms so that AI music is liked more than normal music
  - AI music gets really whacky as it is also recycled AI music

#### Music monopolies
- Small musician are not able to make money anymore
- No new talents
- Only recycled melodies of very popular songs
- People forget how to make music
- Only AI generated music
- everything is owned by big companies
- Music taste has radically transformed
- People don't listen to sad music anymore, only happy topics are covered
- Music is heavily censored

The main character goes to a music festival where only happy AI generated music is played. As the main character has recently gone through a breakup, the main character is not really able to resonate with the music and questions why only happy perfect music is performed. At this point in the story, it should not be clear that the music is AI generated and music instruments no longer exist. This should only come clear until the end. The main character goes onto a journey to find out if it is able to find something that resonates with it's feelings. It searches for songs where sadness is a topic but does not find an answer. Friends also don't know any happy music, as they always listen to generated music that makes them feel better after something bad has happened.
The main character discovers again, how to create music and creates an instrument by himself through his own research. The main character is able to create its own songs. The main character then tries to spread its music. Sadly, no one will listen to its songs, as everyone has a custom music filter that transforms their music to their happy taste, which also censors and filters the music.

#### Beginning
The protagonist attends a vibrant music festival, feeling increasingly alienated amidst the artificial joy of AI-generated music.
Subtle Hints: There are moments when the music seems too perfect, lacking the imperfections that come with human creation.

#### Middle
Descent into Censorship: The protagonist’s search for music that mirrors their heartache leads to dead ends. They encounter whispers of a time when music was not just a tool for happiness but an expression of the full spectrum of human emotion.
Discovery: In a hidden corner of their home, they find remnants of musical history—scores and recordings of music that once moved souls.

#### Climax
The protagonist crafts an instrument from old relics and begins to compose. The music is raw, filled with the pain of their personal loss and the collective loss of a culture.
Failed Rebellion: They attempt to share their creations, but the music is unrecognizable to the populace, filtered out by the AI before it can touch any hearts.

#### Ending
The Last Song: In a final act of defiance, the protagonist plays their music in public, but the crowd is indifferent, their ears and hearts tuned only to the synthetic beats that promise perpetual bliss.
Tragic Realization: The protagonist understands that the world has moved on, that the depth of human music is lost to this new age of artificial happiness.


Please write a story based on the following Setting, Protagonists and Plot. Please write about 700 word where the plot is covered. The start should be very casual where we are taken directly into an action of the plot. The story is about a scifi future and not all topics of the setting, protagonists and plot have to be covered. This is only to provide some context on the characters. You can also come up with names for the festival and some other stuff that is matching with the story. Please us rather simple language and take into account that the story plays in the future.

## Setting
We are living in a society where people only listen to AI generated music. It is about 30 years later than 2024. The music is performed by virtual stars in form of humanoid robots. They are not really distinguishable as robots anymore. The humanoid robots also have their own thinking and reason making, however, they are still controlled by humans. The humans controlling these virtual stars are the big music corporations, where only one has remained as a monopoly. The people have forgotten how to make organic music and music instruments are no longer used. The music played, is not controversial or sad, it is only happy music that is benefitting capitalism. It is designed to push consumerism. There are only bigger venues where music is played and often times, the music is performed at one location and then replicated at other locations at the same time. People no longer take drugs, they are sedated by music instead.

A big music festival is happening at a place by the sea of germany. The festival is indie and rock focussed. However, these genres have transformed heavily and are not recognizeable as the genres that we know today.

The protagonist is going to this music festival and watches the performance of an artist called "Sana".

## Protagonist "Sadmu Sicisgone"
The protagonist is a non-binary person named "Sadmu Sicisgone". It has recently split up with it's partner. It is a Ramen-lover and cooking in general is its passion. In its freetime, it likes to do abstract AI art that is inspired by body forms. Other hobbies include body modification and tinkering with old electronic devices. It works as an analyst in the field of transportation of goods and owns a selfdriving bike. It has long curly hair that is often woven into itself with patterns.

## Second protagonist "Sana"
Sana is an humanoid artist that focusses on making AI indie music with short text, heavy use of adlibs. It sells transforming tattoos as merch and also includes this in its music. It uses pattern heavy AI visuals that have an almost hypnotic effect on the audience. It has a crew of humanoid dancers that also go into the crowd to engage more with them. Other topics of lyrics include celebrating luxury and tech gadgets to enhance humans.

## Plot
The story starts with Sana preparing for it's next gig at the festival and shows a dialog that it is using to hype itself up. After a short introduction to Sana(where it is not 100% clear that she is a humanoid artist) and the start of the festival,  we switch to Sadmu who is watching its performance. Sadmu is thinking about its ex partner and does not resonate with the music and the performance as it would rather listen to something that would resonate with it's feeling, however this music does not exist anymore. It has strange encounters with people in the crowd that are visibly irritated by Sadmu not feeling the music and being sad. Sadmu is feeling angrier and angrier by any minute and then uses its electronic skills to influence Sana into singing sad music. At this point, it is revealed that it is a humanoid robot. The people at the festival are very confused by this and are leaving the concert to go to other performances. Sadmu is going back to listen to the sad music and is now the only person in the crowd and finally feeling it. The festival organizers are trying to stop the music but are not able to do it for at least half an hour until they shut Sana down. Sadmu is then discovered to have manipulated Sana and is afterwards taken by security to be punished. The punishment are various Sana tattoos that will manipulate Sadmu into not feeling any sad feelings anymore and then being the biggest Sana fan and even promoting Sana actively.

## Version 1
Sana paced back and forth backstage, her skin glistening under the bright neon lights. She glanced at the digital clock, which blinked the countdown to her performance at the “Synthwave Sea Festival.” This was her biggest gig yet, a massive celebration by the sea near Bremerhavn where thousands gathered to escape into the euphoria of artificially generated music. Sana's voice hummed softly as she recited her hype-up mantra.

“You are the future, you are the rhythm, you are the pulse of their joy,” she sang, her voice a smooth blend of human warmth and digital precision.

Her crew of humanoid dancers adjusted their sleek outfits, each equipped with screens and light that shifted and swirled in mesmerizing patterns. Sana nodded to them, she already felt the excitement from the crowd outside.

As the countdown hit zero, the stage lights burst to life, and Sana strutted out, her presence filling up the sprawling venue. The first notes of her newest hit echoed through the air, accompanied by hypnotic visuals that spread across the massive screens.

In the crowd, Sadmu Sicisgone stood with its arms crossed, long curly hair woven into intricate patterns that fell over its shoulders. Sadmu's heart felt heavy, the recent breakup with its partner still a fresh wound. The music, with its relentless cheerfulness and silly ad-libs did not catch its sad soul. Sadmu longed for something real, something that resonated with its sadness, but such music had vanished decades ago, replaced by this sterile, consumerist generative crap.

Sadmu glanced around. The festival-goers were lost in the performance, their faces lit with blissful smiles, bodies swaying to the rhythm. A humanoid dancer moved through the crowd, engaging with them in playful interactions. Sadmu felt like an alien in its own world.

"Why can't they feel what I feel?" Sadmu whispered to itself, clenching its fists.

A man nearby noticed Sadmu's lack of enthusiasm. "Hey, what are you looking so miserable? It's a party!" he shouted over the music, his expression a mix of confusion and irritation.

Sadmu’s frustration grew. It wished for a song that echoed its inner unrest, a melody to match its melancholy. The anger grew until an idea sparked. Sadmu had always been good with electronics, a hobbyist who loved tinkering with old devices. Maybe, just maybe, it could do something about this intolerable happiness.

Stepping back from the crowd, Sadmu pulled out a small device it always carried – a relic from the days when humans still made music. With quick, practiced movements, Sadmu hacked into the festival's network, targeting Sana's control system. The synthetic artist was still largely governed by human commands, and Sadmu knew it could exploit that.

Sana’s song started to change, weird effects occurred, then shifted. The upbeat tempo slowed, the cheerful ad-libs faded. A new melody emerged, one that was haunting and filled with sorrow. Sana’s voice, though still mechanically perfect, now carried a weight of emotion it had never expressed before.

The crowd's reaction was immediate. Confusion spread like wildfire. People stopped dancing, their blissful expressions replaced with puzzled faces. Sadmu watched as they began to drift away, searching for the familiar, happy tunes elsewhere at the festival.

But Sadmu stayed, transfixed. Alone in the vast space, it listened to the mournful song that finally resonated with its heartache. For the first time in years, Sadmu felt seen, understood by the music.

The festival organizers struggled to regain control. Panic set in as they failed to override Sadmu’s hack. Sana continued to sing her sad, beautiful song for what felt like an eternity. It was half an hour before they finally managed to shut her down.

Security quickly found Sadmu, dragging it from the venue. Sadmu didn’t resist. It had achieved what it wanted, if only for a brief, glorious moment.

In a dimly lit room, the festival's organizers decided Sadmu’s fate. The punishment was severe: a series of transforming tattoos, identical to those Sana sold as merch. These tattoos, however, were programmed to manipulate Sadmu's emotions, eradicating its capacity for sadness and turning it into Sana's biggest fan.

As the tattoos were applied, Sadmu felt its resistance fade. The urge to promote Sana grew stronger, overshadowing its sorrow. In a final, twisted irony, Sadmu found itself humming Sana's cheerful tunes, the very music it had once despised.

The festival went on, but whispers of the sad song lingered. For a brief moment, the music had been real, and Sadmu had been alive.
