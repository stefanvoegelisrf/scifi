### Excercise: Writing opening lines
- "Das stimmt überhaupt nicht, ich kann es nicht glauben, welche Worte du mir in den Mund legst.", antwortete er.
- "Ist das etwa die Stimme von XYZ die ich hinter mir höre?" fragte ich mich als ich in XYZ vorbeifuhr.
- Zwei Meter breit war dieser Bach mindestens, vielleicht sogar drei. Schätzen konnte ich nicht so gut, aber irgendwie muss ich da rüberkommen.

- He was carefully combin his hair, but the comb slipped his fingers and flew 3 meters away.

### Excercise: Start a story
"Where were you last night?"
"Sigh. Kinda awkward to explain. You know that guy I told you about? The one I spilled my coffee over by accident?"
"Yeah, I remember. He yelled at you, right?"
"Exactly that guy. I met him today again on my way home. And funnily enough, he came up to me and apologized."
"Oh how nice of him, I'm quite a bit suprised to hear, after you mentioned what happened."
"I agree, however, he went on and invited me for a chat at the bar. Turns out, he's working at a place that I would love to work at. I told him a lot about my work and how I want to progress into the future. And guess what?"
"What?"
"I'm having an interview next week to start as XYZ."
"Whoa, congrats. I'm glad to hear that this unfortunate story turned into such a life changing situation"

### Characters
- Character is story and story is character. Story creates character.
- Fiction is a form of memoir. Mine your own life for the details of character. 
- How will your character take cliché and stand it on its head?
- The more you try to force things to fit a formula, the less authentic your book is going to sound.

### Developing ideas
- Great stories often star t with a question. The same is true for chapters and scenes. A novel is the sum total of a series of questions and answers.
- If there are boring bits in your story, you simply have to work your imagination harder. You must find a way of introducing drama into the situation.
